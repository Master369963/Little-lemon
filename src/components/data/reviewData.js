We were looked after very well by Ludovic and the young waitresses and it was nice to have a chat with Laurent. I told him how pleased I was to see that you now have a separate vegetarian menu with a lovely selection of starters and main courses. The meal was lovely and we had a lovely time, thank you for making us so welcome.' },
